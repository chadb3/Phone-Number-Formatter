# Correct Phone Number
 This is to correct phone numbers. Some software I use does not like the following format: (555) - 123 - 4567.

 This will correct it down to 5551234567. Doing it this way will reduce errors introduced by manually typing the numbers.

 I may later add a function to return a phone number in a more human readable form like: (555) - 123 -  4567

 Functionality will be integrated into my call logger python program.

 As of this update, it now translates phonewords by default

## How To Use:
 
After you enter the "phone number" hit enter
```
Enter Phone Number: (123) - 456 - 7890
Before: (123) - 456 - 7890

After: 1234567890
```
