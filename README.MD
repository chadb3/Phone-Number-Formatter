# Correct Phone Number
 This is to correct phone numbers. Some software won't accept phone numbers like: (555) 234-5678 or 555-234-5678

 This will correct it down to: 5552345678

 Doing it this way will reduce errors introduced by manually typing the numbers.

 I may later add a function to return a phone number in a more human readable form like: (555) 234-5678

 Functionality will be integrated into my call logger python program.

 As of this update, it now translates phonewords by default

## How To Use:
 
After you enter the "phone number" hit enter
```
Enter Phone Number: (555) 234-5678
Before: (555) 234-5678

After: 5552345678
```

Phoneword Example:
```
Enter Phone Number: (555) ADG-JMPT
Before: (555) 234-5678

After: 5552345678
```
