# Correct Phone Number
 This is to correct phone numbers. Some software won't accept phone numbers variants like: (555) 234-5678 or 555-234-5678

 This will correct it down to 5552345678

 Using this will reduce errors that could be introduced by manually typing the numbers.

 I may later add a function to return a phone number in a more human readable form like: (555) 234-5678

 Functionality is now integrated into my call logger python program.

 Now translates phonewords by default!

## How To Use:
 
After you enter the "phone number" hit enter
```

Enter Phone Number: (555) 234-5678
Before: (555) 234-5678

After: 5552345678

```

Phoneword Example:
```

Enter Phone Number: (555) ADG-JMPT
Required Translation: True
Before: (555) 234-5678

After: 5552345678

```
