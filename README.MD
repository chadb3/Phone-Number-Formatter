# Correct Phone Number
 This is to correct phone numbers. Some software I use does not like the following format: (555) - 123 - 4567.

 This will correct it down to 5551234567. Doing it this way will reduce errors introduced by manually typing the numbers.

 I may later add a function to return a phone number in a more human readable form like: (555) - 123 -  4567

 Functionality will be integrated into my call logger python program.

## How To Use:
 
 after you enter the "phone number" hit enter

 Enter Phone Number: (123) - 456 - 7890
 1234567890
